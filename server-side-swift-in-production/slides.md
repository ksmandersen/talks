# Let's grade Vapor

- Performance **A+**
- Stability **A-**

^ 3 servers, 100% uptime 6+ months. Tools for reporting, measuring and loggin immature

# Let's grade Vapor

- Performance **A+**
- Stability **A-**
- Framework and language changes **C**

^ Swift still changes a lot and is not ABI stable. A pain when deploying to services
^ Vapor is still young and is already on its 3rd major version (since 2016).

# Deployment

- Vapor Cloud
- Docker
- Heroku
- Dokku

---

# Docker

---

# Docker

- Runs everywhere
- Open Source
- Endlessly configurable
- Run on Linode for $5

---

# WTF is Docker?

---

# Containers

![](slides-containers.gif)

^ A kind of virtulization called Containers
^ Completely self-contained machine with its own OS
^ Runs only one program
^ Does not require same resources as a dedicated virtualized OS
^ Many containers can share the same physical resources (CPU/RAM)

---

# Images

![](slides-images.gif)

^ Snapshots of file systems
^ Always based on another image
^ Incremental size
^ Cached. Makes rebuilding images super fast

---

# Dockerfile

![](slides-docking.mp4)

^ A text file describing steps to build your image
^ Basically a recipe

---

# Dockerfile

# Dokku

- Create a new Ubuntu16.04 server (DigitialOcean or Linode)
- SSH in and run:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dokku/dokku/v0.12.4/bootstrap.sh
sudo DOKKU_TAG=v0.12.4 bash bootstrap.sh
dokku apps:create hello-vapor-3
dokku domains:add hello-vapor-3 your-domain
dokku plugin:install https://github.com/dokku/dokku-mysql.git mysql
dokku mysql:create hello-vapor-db
dokku mysql:link hello-vapor-db hello-vapor-3
```

# Dokku

```bash
vapor new hello-vapor-3 --branch=beta --template=api
git remote add production dokku@your-domain
g push production master
```
